<h1>Open311 Server</h1>
<p>This is a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> based Open311 server being developed as part of Code for Europe project for Aberdeen City Council.</p>

<p>This project is very much in a state of early development so do not expect everything to function or be implemented yet.</p>

<p>The server is built to meet the <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2">Open311 GeoReport v2 specification</a> and <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/Inquiry_v1">Open311 Inquiry v1 specification</a>.</p>
