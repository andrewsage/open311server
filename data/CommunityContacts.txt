We perform regularly in Aberdeen and surrounding areas, but our talents have also been enjoyed in highly prestigious venues such as The Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and The Scottish Exhibition Centre. We also featured  in the BBC's 'Watchnight Celebration' transmitted from The Citadel in Aberdeen in December 2003. One of our major activities each year is the annual UK Sweet Adelines Contest. In May 2003, The Aberdeen Chorus won the Gold Medal at the UK Competition for a record sixth time. Our reputation goes before us - and were asked (and, naturally, accepted!) to compete at the Welsh International Eisteddfod in July 2004. Sweet Adelines  is a truly international organisation dedicated to advancing the musical art form of barbershop through education and performance.. To this end Sweet Adelines International provides an on- going education programme in both the UK and the US in which The Aberdeen Chorus is an active participant. This allows members to advance their own individual vocal skills whilst also learning the craft of singing in the barbershop style.  We regularly recruit new members and any woman over the age of 16 (no upper limit) who might be interested in joining the group is welcome to join us at one of our rehearsals.

The purpose of Kendo is: To Mold the Mind and Body and To Cultivate a Vigorous Spirit.
Through correct and rigid training: To strive for improvement in the art of Kendo to hold in esteem human courtesy and honour to associate with others with sincerity and to forever pursue the cultivation of oneself.
Thus one will be able: To love ones country and society; To contribute to the development of culture and to promote prosperity among all people.
Kendo in Aberdeen is taught with this ethos in mind, so one can build a better self and a better community.
Using the philosophy of "Everyone is everyone's teacher" you should always have an open mind to everyone that you meet, in and out of the Dojo and be the best of yourself at all times.
